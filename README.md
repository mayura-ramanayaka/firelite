## Firelite :fire: :zap:

Firelite is a cross platform, lightweight **SQLite** manager written in [Qt](http://qt.io/). It has a simple UI, including a table designer, query editor, history viewer and few other controls/panes that can be docked, collapsed or removed. Editor comes with syntax highlighting and auto-completion (intellisense) to make it little easier to write complex queries.

## Installers
[Windows](https://github.com/mayurarx/firelite/releases/download/v1.1/Firelite-Installer-Win-1.1.exe) | 
[Linux (Source)](https://github.com/mayurarx/firelite/archive/refs/tags/v1.1.zip)

## Features

* The color scheme for syntax highlighting is inspired by the color scheme for *sequel* files in [notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). It's not a complete clone though!


* Few code samples are grabbed from the qt documentation and tweaked as needed.


* Source is compiled for both Windows and Linux platforms using **MinGW** compiler. And the windows installers are built using **QTIF** (qt installer framework) and available for download in the [releases](https://github.com/mayura-ramanayaka/firelite/releases).
